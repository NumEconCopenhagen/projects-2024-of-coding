This repository includes three projects plus the exam project related to the course "Introduction to Programming." Below, you will find a list and brief description of each project:

**1. Inaugural Project** The inaugural project is our first experience with programming in Python. We aimed to apply simple numerical solutions and simulations to optimize a household utility model. Additionally, this project provided us with an opportunity to work with models in Python, learn project structuring, and present it in an organized manner.
**2. Data project.** We aim to analyse the relationship between Oil Prices and Oil Production. We fetch data from the **FRED database** on **Oil production and oil prices** and show that they are positively correlated. 
**3. Model project.** We utilize an **AS/AD model** and use numerical methods to solve and simulate
**4. Exam project.** Run exam_2024_new.ipynb and get the full output
